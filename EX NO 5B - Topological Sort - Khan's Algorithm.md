# EX 5B Topological Sort - Khan's Algorithm
## DATE:16/11/2025
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Problem Description:
A software development team is preparing for a product release. The release consists of multiple tasks, each dependent on other tasks being completed first. You are to determine a valid order in which all tasks can be completed. If it's not possible due to cyclic dependencies, output that the release cannot be scheduled.

Each task is labeled from 0 to n-1. The dependencies are provided in the form of pairs [a, b] which means task a depends on task b.

Implement a program to find a valid task execution order using topological sort.

Input Format:

An integer n — number of tasks.

An integer m — number of dependencies.

m lines follow with two integers a and b — representing a depends on b.

Output Format:

If a valid order exists, print the task numbers in a possible execution order (space-separated).

If not, print "Release cannot be scheduled".

## Algorithm
1.Start and read the number of tasks n and dependency pairs.

2.Build a directed graph using an adjacency list and compute the indegree of each node.

3.Add all nodes with indegree = 0 (no dependencies) to a queue.

4.While the queue is not empty:

Remove a task, add it to the task order.

Decrease the indegree of its dependent tasks; if any reaches 0, add it to the queue.

5.Check completion:

If all tasks are processed, print the task order; otherwise, print “Release cannot be scheduled.”
